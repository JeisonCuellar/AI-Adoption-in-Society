# üìä AI Integration & EBIT: Industry Impact Study

## 1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how companies operate ‚Äî from automation to decision-making. But integrating AI often requires structural changes: new roles, workflows, or technologies. This study explores how these changes affect profitability, specifically focusing on EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes).

We aim to identify whether the cost of AI integration is offset by EBIT gains within 12‚Äì24 months and compare effects across key sectors (Finance, Healthcare, and Government).

## 2. Hypothesis

Companies in sectors undergoing significant structural change (e.g., operational redesign, leadership shifts, AI upskilling) due to AI integration will experience EBIT improvements within 12‚Äì24 months ‚Äî with the Financial and Medical industries showing the highest net gains.

## 3. Methodology

- **Data Sources**: McKinsey, Stanford AI Index, public company earnings reports, industry whitepapers
- **Industries Studied**: Finance, Healthcare, Government
- **Indicators**:
  - Structural change markers (e.g. AI roles, workflow redesign)
  - EBIT performance before and after AI implementation
- **Timeline**: 12‚Äì24 month ROI window
- **Tools**: Python (for data analysis), Tableau or matplotlib (for visualization)

## 4. Industry Background

### 4.1 McKinsey (Business Sector)
- AI boosts productivity, but only 1% of companies are ‚ÄúAI mature‚Äù
- Biggest EBIT gains occur with strong governance + KPI tracking
- Finance and Healthcare lead in ROI visibility

### 4.2 Stanford (Academic Sector)
- Industry produces 90% of top AI models
- Academia calls for public-sector alignment, but lags in deployment
- Highlights risk of brain-drain from academia to industry

## 5. Case Studies / Results

*(To be filled as you gather data ‚Äî we can work on this together!)*

- Company A (Finance): EBIT increase of X% within 18 months
- Company B (Healthcare): Adjusted workflows + positive ROI
- Company C (Government): Minimal structural change = flat EBIT

---

## 6. Conclusion

*(Write once results are added)*  
Early indicators suggest that structured, well-managed AI integration delivers EBIT gains ‚Äî particularly in Finance and Healthcare. Organizations that lack roadmap or structural readiness may face delayed or reduced ROI.
